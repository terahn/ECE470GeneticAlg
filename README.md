# Optimizing Advertisement Utility

This is a project completed for ECE 470 at the University of Victoria made by Terahn Harrison (V00842812), Chris Ellard (V00878993), and Thor Reite (V00809409).


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Installing

Make sure you have Python 2.7 installed

Install relevant libraries:

```
python -mpip install -U matplotlib
```

If you have troubles installing the matplotlib library, you can use the genetics_no_graph.py file to run the program instead of the genetics.py file.

## Running the algorithm

To run the algorithm, execute the following command:

```
python genetics.py
```

Or execute this command if you could not install the matplotlib library:

```
python genetics_no_graph.py
```
